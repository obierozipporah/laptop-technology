## Introduction

Welcome to the Audiophile e-commerce web store project. I completed this project as part of my training in the Azubi Africa Frontend Development program. The brief in this project was to build the user facing side of an e-commerce store that sells audio equipment. We were tasked with building the frontend of this project according to the specifications given in a Figma design file.

The project has been deployed on Vercel [here](https://audiophile-ecommerce-project-delta.vercel.app/)

In addition to the features above the application allows users to get a detailed view of any product they may be interested in. It is on this page that the user is able to first interact with the cart in the store.
